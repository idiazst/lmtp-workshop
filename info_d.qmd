How many times have you started to read a paper for a new method in the causal inference literature that contains the sentence "assume the treatment or exposure is binary..."?

Well not anymore ðŸ¥³. Assume $A$ is a binary, categorical, or continuous variable! Let $\dd(a, w, \epsilon)$ be a function that maps $A$, $W$, and potentially a randomizer $\epsilon$ to a new value of $A$. We will often refer to the function $\dd$ as a *shift* function.

Our focus in this workshop is estimating the causal effect of an intervention $d$ on the outcome $Y$, through the causal parameter

$$
\theta = \E[Y(\bar A^{\dd})]\text{,}
$$

where $Y(\bar A^\dd)$ is the counterfactual outcome in a world, where possibly contrary to fact, each entry of $\bar{A}$ was modified according to the function $\dd$. When $Y$ is continuous, $\theta$ is the mean population value of $Y$ under intervention $\dd$; when $Y$ is dichotomous, $\theta$ is the population proportion of event $Y$ under intervention $\dd$. Similarly, when $Y$ is the indicator of an event by end of the study, $\theta$ is defined as the cumulative incidence of $Y$ under intervention $\dd$.

### Identification of the causal parameter

::: callout-important
## Assumptions

1.  *Positivity*. If $(a_t, h_t) \in \text{supp}\{A_t, H_t\}$ then $\dd(a_t, h_t) \in \text{supp}\{A_t, H_t\}$ for $t \in \{1, ..., \tau\}$.

    > If there is a unit with observed treatment value $a_t$ and covariates $h_t$, there must also be a unit with treatment value $\dd(a_t, h_t)$ and covariates $h_t$.

2.  *Exchangeability.* $A_t \perp \!\!\! \perp Y(\bar{a}) | H_t$ for all $\bar{a} \in \mathop{\mathrm{supp}}\bar{A}$ and $t \in \{1, ..., \tau\}$.

3.  *Consistency.* $\bar{A} = \bar{a} \implies Y = Y(\bar{a})$ for all $\bar{a} \in \mathop{\mathrm{supp}}\bar{A}$.

Assuming ..., $\theta$ is identified from the observed data by:

## Theorem

Set $\m_{\tau+1} = Y$\> For $t = \tau, ..., 1$, recursively define

$$
\m_t: (a_t, h_t) \rightarrow \E[\m_{t + 1}(A^{\dd}_{t+1}, H_{t + 1}) \mid A_t = a_t, H_t = h_t],
$$

and define $\theta = E[\m_1(A^{\dd}_1, L_1)]$.
:::

As an example, set $\tau = 2$. Then we have

```{=tex}
\begin{align} \m_3(A_3^d, H_3) &= Y   \\  \m_2(A_2^d, H_2) &= \E\left[\m_3(A_3^d, H_3)\mid(A_2^d, H_2)\right] \\\m_1(A_1^d, L_1) &= \E\left[\m_2(A_2^d, H_2)\mid(A_1^d, L_1)\right] \\\theta &= \E\left[\m_1(A_1^d, L_1)\right]

\end{align}
```
### Static Interventions

Let $A$ denote a binary vector, such as receiving a medication, and define $\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = 1$. This intervention characterizes a hypothetical world where all members of the population receive treatment.

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Static intervention

An intervention is static if the function $\dd_t$ always returns the same value regardless of the input.
:::

### Dynamic Treatment Regime

Let $A_t$ denote a binary vector, such as receiving a medication, and $H_t$ a numeric vector, such as a measure of discomfort. For a given value of $\delta$, define $$
\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = \begin{cases}
1 &\text{ if } h_t > \delta \\
0 &\text{ otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Dynamic treatment regime

Interventions where the output of the function $\dd_t$ depends **only** **on the covariates** $H_t$ are referred to as being dynamic.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Example

@rudolph2022buprenorphine examined a Buprenorphine (BUP-NX) dosing strategy among a population of patients who were taking BUP-NX for opioid use disorder. Under the hypothetical intervention, patients who reported opioid use during the week prior to a physicians exam received a BUP-NX dose increase while patients who did not report prior-week opioid use maintained the same dose. Let $A_t$ be a binary indicator for BUP-NX dose increase at week $t$ compared to week $t-1$ and $X_t$ be an indicator for opioid use at week $t$. Then,

$$
\dd(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = \begin{cases}
1 \text{ if } x_{t-1} = 1\\
0 \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

### Treatment Initiation with Grace Period

### Modified Treatment Policies

Explain why MTPs are useful:

-   help with positiivty violations

-   help characterize realistic interventions

-   assess interventions you could never run an RCT for

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Modified treatment policy

An intervention characterized by a hypothetical world where the *natural* value of treatment is modified is called a *modified treatment policy*.

#### Additive and multiplicative shift MTP

Let $A_t$ denote a numeric vector. Assume that $A_t$ has support in the data such that $P(A_t \leq u(h_t) \mid H_t = h_t) = 1$. For a value of $\delta$, define $$
\dd(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = \begin{cases}
a_t + \delta &\text{ if } a_t + \delta \leq u(h_t) \\
a_t &\text{ otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

Under this intervention, the natural value of exposure at time $t$ is increased by the analyst-defined value $\delta$, whenever such an increase is feasible. This MTP is referred to as an *additive shift* *MTP.*

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Example
:::

We can similarly define a multiplicative *shift MTP* as

$$
\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = \begin{cases}
a_t \times \delta &\text{ if } a_t \times \delta \leq u(h_t) \\
a_t &\text{ otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Example

@nugent2023demonstration evaluated the association between county-level measures of mobility and incident COVID-19 cases in the United States in the Summer and Fall of 2022. They considered both hypothetical additive and multiplicative MTPs; for example, they defined a multiplicative MTP where a measure for the density of mobile devices visiting commercial locations was decreased by 25%:

$$
\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = a_t \times 0.75.
$$
:::

#### Threshold MTP

### Incremental Propensity Score Interventions

Let $A$ denote a binary vector, $\epsilon \sim U(0, 1)$, and $\delta$ be an analyst-defined risk ratio limited to be between $0$ and $1$. If we were interested in an intervention that decreased the likelihood of receiving treatment, define\
$$
\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \epsilon_t) = \begin{cases}
a_t &\text{ if } \epsilon_t < \delta \\
0 &\text{ otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$In this case, we have $\g^\dd(a_t \mid H_t) = a_t \delta \g_t(1 \mid H_t) + (1 - a_t) (1 - \delta \g_t(1\mid H_t))$, which leads to a risk ratio of $\g_t^\dd(1 \mid H_t)/\g_t(1\mid H_t) = \delta$ for comparing the propensity score post- vs pre-intervention. Conversely, if we were interested in an intervention that increased the likelihood of receiving treatment, define\
$$
\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \epsilon_t) = \begin{cases}
a_t &\text{ if } \epsilon_t < \delta \\
1 &\text{ otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

Now $\g_t^\dd(a_t \mid H_t) = a_t (1 - \delta \g_t(0\mid H_t)) + (1 - a_t) \delta \g_t(0 \mid H_t)$, which implies a risk ratio $\g_t^\dd(0\mid H_t)/\g(0\mid H_t) = \delta$.

## Incremental propensity score intervention

An intervention where the conditional probability of treatment is shifted.

## Example

Using electronic health record data, @wen2023intervention estimated the effect of increasing the proportion of PrEP uptake on bacterial STI among cis-gender males being tested for STIs and that do not have HIV. Let $A_t$ be a binary indicator for PrEP initiation at week $t$, and $L'_t$ be a binary indicator for any STI testing and being HIV-free at week $t$. They defined a "medium" successful PrEP uptake intervention as

$$
\dd(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = \begin{cases}
a_t &\text{ if } l'_t = 1 \text{ and } \epsilon_t < 0.85 \\
1 &\text{ otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$
