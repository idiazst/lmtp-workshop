Have you ever begun reading a paper in the causal inference literature and encountered the phrase "assume the treatment or exposure is a binary..."? While assuming a variable is binary can simplify a problem, nature rarely reflects this paradigm.

**Instead, lets assume** $A$ **is a binary, categorical, or continuous variable!**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the previous section, we defined $\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \epsilon_t)$ as a function that maps $A_t$, $H_t$, and potentially a randomizer $\epsilon_t$ to a new value of $A_t$. Our focus henceforth is estimating the causal effect of an intervention, characterized by $\dd$ on the outcome $Y$, through the causal parameter

$$
\theta = \E[Y^{\bar A^{\dd}}]\text{,}
$$

where $Y^{\bar A^{\dd}}$ is the counterfactual outcome in a world, where possibly contrary to fact, each entry of $\bar{A}$ was modified according to the function $\dd$.

-   When $Y$ is continuous, $\theta$ is the mean population value of $Y$ under intervention $\dd$.

-   When $Y$ is dichotomous, $\theta$ is the population proportion of event $Y$ under intervention $\dd$.

-   When $Y$ is the indicator of an event by end of the study, $\theta$ is defined as the cumulative incidence of $Y$ under intervention $\dd$.

### Identification of the causal parameter

Recall that the fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can't observe the alternative worlds which we use to define causal effects. If we can't observe counterfactual variables, then how can we learn a causal effect? Under a set of certain assumptions, we can *identify* a causal parameter from observed data. These assumptions are called identification assumptions.

## Identification Assumptions

1.  *Positivity*. If $(a_t, h_t) \in \text{supp}\{A_t, H_t\}$ then $\dd(a_t, h_t) \in \text{supp}\{A_t, H_t\}$ for $t \in \{1, ..., \tau\}$.

    > If there is a unit with observed treatment value $a_t$ and covariates $h_t$, there must also be a unit with treatment value $\dd(a_t, h_t)$ and covariates $h_t$.

2.  *Conditional Exchangeability.* $A_t \perp \!\!\! \perp Y^{\bar{a}} | H_t$ for all $\bar{a} \in \mathop{\mathrm{supp}}\bar{A}$ and $t \in \{1, ..., \tau\}$.

    > For all times $t$, the potential outcomes $Y^{\bar{a}}$ are independent of treatment assignment.

3.  *Consistency.* $\bar{A} = \bar{a} \implies Y = Y(\bar{a})$ for all $\bar{a} \in \mathop{\mathrm{supp}}\bar{A}$.

    > The observed outcome for a unit who received a particular treatment level is the same as the potential outcome that would have been observed if that unit had been assigned to that treatment level.

Assuming the above, $\theta$ is identified from the observed data with:

## Theorem

Set $\m_{\tau+1} = Y$ For $t = \tau, ..., 1$, recursively define

$$
\m_t: (a_t, h_t) \rightarrow \E[\m_{t + 1}(A^{\dd}_{t+1}, H_{t + 1}) \mid A_t = a_t, H_t = h_t],
$$

and define $\theta = E[\m_1(A^{\dd}_1, L_1)]$.
:::

As an example, set $\tau = 2$. Then we have

```{=tex}
\begin{align} \m_3(A_3^d, H_3) &= Y   \\  \m_2(A_2^d, H_2) &= \E\left[\m_3(A_3^d, H_3)\mid(A_2^d, H_2)\right] \\\m_1(A_1^d, L_1) &= \E\left[\m_2(A_2^d, H_2)\mid(A_1^d, L_1)\right] \\\theta &= \E\left[\m_1(A_1^d, L_1)\right]

\end{align}
```
### Static Interventions

Let $A$ denote a binary vector, such as receiving a medication, and define $\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = 1$. This intervention characterizes a hypothetical world where all members of the population receive treatment.

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Static intervention

An intervention is static if the function $\dd_t$ always returns the same value regardless of the input.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Example

Let's say we were interested in the effect of randomizing patients with opioid use disorder to injection naltrexone ($A=1$) vs. sublingual buprenorphine ($A=0$). We would contrast the counterfactual outcomes in a hypothetical world in which all units were treated with injection naltrexone $\dd_1=1$ versus a hypothetical world in which all units were treated with buprenorphine $\dd_0=0$. This gives us the well-known average (comparative) treatment effect (ATE). $$\E[Y^{\bar A^{\dd_1}} - Y^{\bar A^{\dd_0}}] = \E[Y^{A=1} - Y^{A=0}] $$.
:::

### Dynamic Treatment Regime

Let $A_t$ denote a binary vector, such as receiving a medication, and $H_t$ a numeric vector, such as a measure of discomfort. For a given value of $\delta$, define $$
\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = \begin{cases}
1 &\text{ if } h_t > \delta \\
0 &\text{ otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Dynamic treatment regime

Interventions where the output of the function $\dd_t$ depends **only** **on the covariates** $H_t$ are referred to as being dynamic.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Example

@rudolph2022buprenorphine examined a Buprenorphine (BUP-NX) dosing strategy among a population of patients who were taking BUP-NX for opioid use disorder. Under the hypothetical intervention, patients who reported opioid use during the week prior to a physicians exam received a BUP-NX dose increase while patients who did not report prior-week opioid use maintained the same dose. Let $A_t$ be a binary indicator for BUP-NX dose increase at week $t$ compared to week $t-1$ and $X_t$ be an indicator for opioid use at week $t$. Then,

$$
\dd(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = \begin{cases}
1 \text{ if } x_{t-1} = 1\\
0 \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

### Modified Treatment Policies

While much attention is given to static and dynamic interventions, their use is often accompanied by a few key problems.

1.  **Defining causal effects in terms of hypothetical interventions where treatment is applied to all units may be inconceivable.** For example, we may be interested to know if reducing surgery time reduces surgical complications. However, it's inconceivable to reduce all surgeries to a set maximum time-length.

2.  **Defining causal effects in terms of hypothetical interventions where treatment is applied to all units may induce positivity violations.**

A solution to these problems is to instead define causal effects using **modified treatment policies (MTP).**

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## Modified treatment policy

An intervention characterized by a hypothetical world where the *natural* value of treatment is modified is called a *modified treatment policy*.
:::

#### Additive and multiplicative shift MTP

Let $A_t$ denote a numeric vector. Assume that $A_t$ has support in the data such that $P(A_t \leq u(h_t) \mid H_t = h_t) = 1$. For an analyst-defined value of $\delta$, define $$
\dd(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = \begin{cases}
a_t + \delta &\text{ if } a_t + \delta \leq u(h_t) \\
a_t &\text{ otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

Under this intervention, the natural value of exposure at time $t$ is increased by the analyst-defined value $\delta$, whenever such an increase is feasible. This MTP is referred to as an *additive shift* *MTP.*

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Example

@diaz2023nonparametric estimated the effect of increasing P/F ratio (a measure of hypoxemia) by 50 units on survival among those patients with acute respiratory failure (a P/F ratio \< 300).

$$
\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = \begin{cases}
a_t + 50 &\text{ if } a_t \leq 300 \\
a_t &\text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
:::

We can similarly define a multiplicative *shift MTP* as

$$
\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = \begin{cases}
a_t \times \delta &\text{ if } a_t \times \delta \leq u(h_t) \\
a_t &\text{ otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Example

@nugent2023demonstration evaluated the association between county-level measures of mobility and incident COVID-19 cases in the United States in the Summer and Fall of 2022. They considered both hypothetical additive and multiplicative MTPs; for example, they defined a multiplicative MTP where a measure for the density of mobile devices visiting commercial locations was decreased by 25%:

$$
\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = a_t \times 0.75.
$$
:::

### Random Interventions

Let $A$ denote a binary vector, $\epsilon \sim U(0, 1)$, and $\epsilon$ be an analyst-defined value between 0 and 1. We may then define randomized interventions. For example, imagine we are interested in a hypothetical world where half of all smokers quit smoking. This intervention would be defined as

$$
\\d_t(a_t, \epsilon_t) = \begin{cases}
0 &\text{ if } \epsilon_t < 0.5 \text{ and } a_t = 1 \\
a_t &\text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}.
$$

### Incremental Propensity Score Interventions

Let $A$ denote a binary vector, $\epsilon \sim U(0, 1)$, and $\delta$ be an analyst-defined risk ratio limited to be between $0$ and $1$. If we were interested in an intervention that decreased the likelihood of receiving treatment, define\
$$
\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \epsilon_t) = \begin{cases}
a_t &\text{ if } \epsilon_t < \delta \\
0 &\text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}.
$$In this case, we have $\g^\dd(a_t \mid H_t) = a_t \delta \g_t(1 \mid H_t) + (1 - a_t) (1 - \delta \g_t(1\mid H_t))$, which leads to a risk ratio of $\g_t^\dd(1 \mid H_t)/\g_t(1\mid H_t) = \delta$ for comparing the propensity score post- vs pre-intervention. Conversely, if we were interested in an intervention that increased the likelihood of receiving treatment, define\
$$
\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \epsilon_t) = \begin{cases}
a_t &\text{ if } \epsilon_t < \delta \\
1 &\text{ otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

Now $\g_t^\dd(a_t \mid H_t) = a_t (1 - \delta \g_t(0\mid H_t)) + (1 - a_t) \delta \g_t(0 \mid H_t)$, which implies a risk ratio $\g_t^\dd(0\mid H_t)/\g(0\mid H_t) = \delta$.

## Incremental propensity score intervention

An intervention where the conditional probability of treatment is shifted.

::: {.callout-tip icon="false"}
## Example

Using electronic health record data, @wen2023intervention estimated the effect of increasing the proportion of PrEP uptake on bacterial STI among cis-gender males being tested for STIs and that do not have HIV. Let $A_t$ be a binary indicator for PrEP initiation at week $t$, and $L_t$ be a binary indicator for any STI testing and being HIV-free at week $t$. They defined a "medium" successful PrEP uptake intervention as

$$
\dd(a_t, h_t, \epsilon) = \begin{cases}
a_t &\text{ if } l_t = 1 \text{ and } \epsilon_t < 0.85 \\
1 &\text{ otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$
