The super learner algorithm is an ensemble learner than incorporates a set of candidate models through a weighted convex-combination based on cross-validation. Asymptotically, this weighted combination of models, called the meta-learner, will outperform any single one of its components.\nlmtp uses the implementation of the super learner provided by the SuperLearner package. The algorithms to be used in the super learner are specified with the lrnrs_trt and lrnrs_outcome arguments. The outcome variable type should guide users on selecting the appropriate candidate learners for use with the lrnrs_outcome argument. Regardless of whether an exposure is continuous, dichotomous, or categorical, the exposure mechanism is estimated using classification. Therefore only include candidate learners capable of binary classification with the lrnrs_trt argument.\nCandidate learners that rely on cross-validation for the tuning of hyper-parameters should support grouped data if used with lrnrs_trt. Because estimation of the treatment mechanism relies on the augmented \\(2n\\) duplicated data set, duplicated observations must be put into the same fold during sample-splitting. This is done automatically by the package.\n\n\nReferences\nDíaz, I., Williams, N., Hoffman, K. L., & Schenck, E. J. (2023).

    "text": "SER 2024 - Austin, Texas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModified treatment policies (MTPs) are a class of interventions that generalize static and dynamic interventions for categorical, continuous, and multivariate exposures. MTPs are hypothetical interventions where the post-intervention is defined as a modification of the natural value of the exposure that can depend on the unit’s history. This short course will introduce the lmtp R package for estimating the causal effects of MTPs in both point-treatment and longitudinal studies. We will discuss identification of MTPs, estimation with a targeted minimum-loss based estimator and a sequentially doubly-robust estimator, and provide guidance on estimator choice.\n\n\n\n\nLearning objectives\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:\n\nDefine MTPs intuitively and using notation, and understand how they generalize static and dynamic interventions.\nEstimate the effect of a static or dynamic intervention with for point-treatment and longitudinal studies.\nEstimate the effect of an MTP on a continuous-valued exposure with for point-treatment and longitudinal studies.\nEstimate the effect of multivariate exposures with for point-treatment and longitudinal studies.\n\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\n\nTime\nTopic\n\n\n\n\n1:00 PM - 1:15 PM\nIntroductions\n\n\n1:15 PM - 1:30 PM\nFrom observed data to causal estimands\n\n\n1:30 PM - 2:30 PM\nGeneralizing interventions using MTPs\n\n\n2:30 PM - 2:50 PM\nThe estimator landscape\n\n\n2:50 PM - 3:00 PM\nBreak\n\n\n3:00 PM - 3:15 PM\nSetting up the correct data structure\n\n\n3:15 PM - 4:45 PM\nEstimating effects using the lmtp package\n\n\n4:45 PM - 5:00 PM\nQ + A\n\n\n\n\n\nwebR\nThis workshop was prepared using Quarto and webR.
