Assume \\(A\\) is a binary, categorical, or continuous variable! Let \\(\\dd(a, w, \\epsilon)\\) be a function that maps \\(A\\), \\(W\\), and potentially a randomizer \\(\\epsilon\\) to a new value of \\(A\\). We will often refer to the function \\(\\dd\\) as a shift function.\nOur focus in this workshop is estimating the causal effect of an intervention \\(d\\) on the outcome \\(Y\\), through the causal parameter\n\\[\n\\theta = \\E[Y(\\bar A^{\\dd})]\\text{,}\n\\]\nwhere \\(Y(\\bar A^\\dd)\\) is the counterfactual outcome in a world, where possibly contrary to fact, each entry of \\(\\bar{A}\\) was modified according to the function \\(\\dd\\). When \\(Y\\) is continuous, \\(\\theta\\) is the mean population value of \\(Y\\) under intervention \\(\\dd\\); when \\(Y\\) is dichotomous, \\(\\theta\\) is the population proportion of event \\(Y\\) under intervention \\(\\dd\\). Similarly, when \\(Y\\) is the indicator of an event by end of the study, \\(\\theta\\) is defined as the cumulative incidence of \\(Y\\) under intervention \\(\\dd\\).\n\nIdentification of the causal parameter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumptions\n\n\n\n\nPositivity.

This intervention characterizes a hypothetical world where all members of the population receive treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatic intervention\n\n\n\nAn intervention is static if the function \\(\\dd_t\\) always returns the same value regardless of the input.\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Treatment Regime\nLet \\(A_t\\) denote a binary vector, such as receiving a medication, and \\(H_t\\) a numeric vector, such as a measure of discomfort. For a given value of \\(\\delta\\), define \\[\n\\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \\epsilon) = \\begin{cases}\n1 &\\text{ if } h_t &gt; \\delta \\\\\n0 &\\text{ otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic treatment regime\n\n\n\nInterventions where the output of the function \\(\\dd_t\\) depends only on the covariates \\(H_t\\) are referred to as being dynamic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nRudolph, Williams, et al. (2022) examined a Buprenorphine (BUP-NX) dosing strategy among a population of patients who were taking BUP-NX for opioid use disorder. Under the hypothetical intervention, patients who reported opioid use during the week prior to a physicians exam received a BUP-NX dose increase while patients who did not report prior-week opioid use maintained the same dose. Let \\(A_t\\) be a binary indicator for BUP-NX dose increase at week \\(t\\) compared to week \\(t-1\\) and \\(X_t\\) be an indicator for opioid use at week \\(t\\).

Assume that \\(A_t\\) has support in the data such that \\(P(A_t \\leq u(h_t) \\mid H_t = h_t) = 1\\). For a value of \\(\\delta\\), define \\[\n\\dd(a_t, h_t, \\epsilon) = \\begin{cases}\na_t + \\delta &\\text{ if } a_t + \\delta \\leq u(h_t) \\\\\na_t &\\text{ otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nUnder this intervention, the natural value of exposure at time \\(t\\) is increased by the analyst-defined value \\(\\delta\\), whenever such an increase is feasible. This MTP is referred to as an additive shift MTP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can similarly define a multiplicative shift MTP as\n\\[\n\\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \\epsilon) = \\begin{cases}\na_t \\times \\delta &\\text{ if } a_t \\times \\delta \\leq u(h_t) \\\\\na_t &\\text{ otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nNugent and Balzer (2023) evaluated the association between county-level measures of mobility and incident COVID-19 cases in the United States in the Summer and Fall of 2022. They considered both hypothetical additive and multiplicative MTPs; for example, they defined a multiplicative MTP where a measure for the density of mobile devices visiting commercial locations was decreased by 25%:\n\\[\n\\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \\epsilon) = a_t \\times 0.75.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nThreshold MTP\n\n\n\nStochastic Interventions\n\nRandomized Interventions\n\n\nIncremental Propensity Score Interventions\nLet \\(A\\) denote a binary vector, \\(\\epsilon \\sim U(0, 1)\\), and \\(\\delta\\) be an analyst-defined risk ratio limited to be between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). If we were interested in an intervention that decreased the likelihood of receiving treatment, define\n\\[\n\\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \\epsilon_t) = \\begin{cases}\na_t &\\text{ if } \\epsilon_t &lt; \\delta \\\\\n0 &\\text{ otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]In this case, we have \\(\\g^\\dd(a_t \\mid H_t) = a_t \\delta \\g_t(1 \\mid H_t) + (1 - a_t) (1 - \\delta \\g_t(1\\mid H_t))\\), which leads to a risk ratio of \\(\\g_t^\\dd(1 \\mid H_t)/\\g_t(1\\mid H_t) = \\delta\\) for comparing the propensity score post- vs pre-intervention. Conversely, if we were interested in an intervention that increased the likelihood of receiving treatment, define\n\\[\n\\dd_t(a_t, h_t, \\epsilon_t) = \\begin{cases}\na_t &\\text{ if } \\epsilon_t &lt; \\delta \\\\\n1 &\\text{ otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nNow \\(\\g_t^\\dd(a_t \\mid H_t) = a_t (1 - \\delta \\g_t(0\\mid H_t)) + (1 - a_t) \\delta \\g_t(0 \\mid H_t)\\), which implies a risk ratio \\(\\g_t^\\dd(0\\mid H_t)/\\g(0\\mid H_t) = \\delta\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncremental propensity score intervention\n\n\n\nAn intervention where the conditional probability of treatment is shifted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\nUsing electronic health record data, Wen, Marcus, and Young (2023) estimated the effect of increasing the proportion of PrEP uptake on bacterial STI among cis-gender males being tested for STIs and that do not have HIV.

It‚Äôs now time to construct estimators.\n\nSequential Regression Estimator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm: Sequential regressions\n\n\n\n\nSet \\(\\m_{i,\\tau +1} = Y_i\\).\nFor \\(t = \\tau, ..., 1\\):\n\nUsing a pre-specified parametric model, regress \\(\\m_{i,\\tau +1}\\) on \\(\\{A_{i, t}, H_{i,t}\\}\\).\nGenerate predictions from this model with \\(A_{i,t}\\) changed to \\(A^{\\dd}_{i,t}\\). Set \\(\\m_{i, t}\\) as these predictions.\n\nTake the final estimate as \\(\\hat{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\m_{i, 1}\\).\nCompute standard errors using a bootstrap of steps 1 and 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nDensity-ratio estimation\nThe following three estimators all rely on estimating the density ratio \\(r_t(a_t, h_t) = \\frac{\\g_t^\\dd(a_t \\mid h_t)}{\\g_t(a_t \\mid h_t)}\\). We will often refer to this ratio as the intervention mechanism throughout the workshop.\nWe can directly estimate this density ratio with a classification trick. This process is fully automated and hidden from the user. Specifically, the IPW, TMLE, and SDR estimation methods require estimation of the ratio of the densities of \\(A_t^\\dd\\) and \\(A_t\\), conditional on the history \\(H_t\\), defined as \\(r_t\\) above. This is achieved through computing the odds in a classification problem in an augmented dataset with \\(2n\\) observations where the outcome is the auxiliary variable \\(\\Lambda\\) (defined below) and the predictors are the variables \\(A_t\\) and \\(H_t\\). In the \\(2n\\) augmented data set, the data structure at time \\(t\\) is redefined as\n\\[\n(H_{\\lambda, i, t}, A_{\\lambda, i, t}, \\Lambda_{\\lambda, i} : \\lambda = 0, 1; i = 1, ..., n)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Lambda_{\\lambda, i} = \\lambda_i\\) indexes duplicate values. For all duplicated observations \\(\\lambda\\in\\{0,1\\}\\) with the same \\(i\\), \\(H_{\\lambda, i, t}\\) is the same. For \\(\\lambda = 0\\), \\(A_{\\lambda, i, t}\\) equals the observed exposure values \\(A_{i, t}\\), whereas for \\(\\lambda=1\\), \\(A_{\\lambda, i, t}\\) equals the exposure values under the intervention \\(\\dd\\), namely \\(A^{\\dd}_t\\). The classification approach to density ratio estimation proceeds by estimating the conditional probability that \\(\\Delta=1\\) in this dataset, and dividing it by the corresponding estimate of the conditional probability that \\(\\Delta=0\\). Specifically, denoting \\(p^\\lambda\\) the distribution of the data in the augmented dataset, we have:\n\\[\nr_t(a_t, h_t) = \\frac{p^\\lambda(a_t, h_t \\mid \\Lambda =\n    1)}{p^\\lambda(a_t, h_t \\mid \\Lambda =\n    0)}=\\frac{p^\\lambda(\\Lambda = 1\\mid A_t=a_t,\n    H_t=h_t)}{p^\\lambda(\\Lambda = 0\\mid A_t=a_t, H_t=h_t)}\n\\]\n\n\nInverse Probability Weighting\n\\[\n\\theta = \\E \\bigg[ \\bigg\\{\\prod_{t=1}^\\tau r_t(a_t, h_t) \\bigg\\} Y \\bigg]\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm: IPW Estimator\n\n\n\n\nConstruct estimates of \\(r_{i,t}(a_t, h_t)\\) using the density ratio classification trick and a pre-specified parametric model.\nDefine the weights \\(w_{i,t} = \\prod_{t=1}^\\tau r_{i,t}(a_t, h_t)\\).\nTake the final estimate as \\(\\hat{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n w_{i,t}\\times y_i\\).\nCompute standard errors using a bootstrap of steps 1-3.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoubly Robust Estimators\nThe sequential regressions and IPW estimators are parametric estimators. We will now turn our attention to two non-parametric estimators. Key to constructing these estimators is the efficient influence function (EIF). The EIF characterizes the asymptotic behavior of all regular and efficient estimators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumptions\n\n\n\n\nThe treatment \\(A\\) is discrete, or\nIf \\(A\\) is continuous, the function \\(\\dd\\) is piecewise smooth invertible\nThe function \\(\\dd\\) does not depend on the observed distribution \\(\\P\\)\n\n\n\nINSERT HERE THE DEFINITION OF PIECEWISE SMOOTH INVERTIBILITY\nTaken together, these assumptions ensure that the efficient influence function of \\(\\theta\\) for interventions \\(\\dd\\) have a structure similar to the influence function for the effect of dynamic regimes. This allows for multiply robust estimation, which is not generally possible for interventions \\(\\dd\\) that depend on \\(\\P\\).\nDefine the function\n\\[\n\\phi_t: o \\mapsto \\sum_{s=t}^\\tau \\bigg( \\prod_{k=t}^s r_k(a_k, h_k)\\bigg) \\big\\{\\m_{s+1}(a_{s+1}^\\dd, h_{s+1}) - \\m_s(a_s, h_s) \\big\\} + \\m_t(a_t^\\dd, h_t).\n\\]\nThe efficient influence function for estimating \\(\\theta = \\E[\\m_1(A^\\dd, L_1)]\\) in the non-parametric model is given by \\(\\phi_1(O) - \\theta\\). In the case of single time-point, the influence function simplifies to\n\\[\nr(a, w)\\{Y - \\m(a,w)\\} + \\m(a^{\\dd},w) - \\theta.\n\\]\n\nTargeted Minimum-Loss Based Estimation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm: TMLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequentially Doubly Robust Estimator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm: SDR Estimator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing an Estimator\nHow should we choose which estimator to use? In general we never recommend using the IPW or sequential regression estimator. Both require the use of correctly pre-specified parametric models for valid statistical inference (ya right üòÇ). The TMLE and SDR estimators, however, are both doubly or sequentially doubly robust and can be used with machine-learning algorithms while remaining \\(\\sqrt{n}\\)-consistent.\nWait, what does it mean for an estimator to be doubly robust? For the simple case of a single time point, an estimator is considered doubly robust if it is able to produce a consistent estimate of the target parameter as long as at least one of the nuisance parameters is consistently estimated. For time-varying setting, an estimator is doubly robust if, for some time \\(s\\), all outcome regressions for \\(t &gt;s\\) are consistently estimated and all intervention mechanisms for \\(t \\leq s\\) are consistently estimated. Sequential double robustness (often also referred to as \\(2^\\tau\\)-multiply robust) implies that an estimator is consistent if for all times either the outcome or intervention mechanism is consistently estimated.\nWhile the SDR estimator may be more robust to model misspecification, the TMLE does have the advantage of being a substitution estimator. Because of this, estimates from the TMLE are guaranteed to stay within the valid range of the outcome. Taken together, this leads to the following recommendations for choosing between the TMLE and SDR:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nIf treatment is not time-varying, use the TMLE.\nIf treatment is time-varying first try the SDR.\nIf the SDR estimator produces ‚Äúout-of-bounds‚Äù estimates, instead use the TMLE.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

The data is based on a database of over 1,500 patients hospitalised at Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital prior to 15 May 2020 with COVID-19 confirmed through PCR. To replicate a two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT), we‚Äôve simulated a hypothetical treatment variable (A) that is randomly assigned for each observation with probability 0.5.\nThe outcome of interest (event) is intubation or death by 14-days post-hospitalization; treatment is associated with increased survival. Baseline covariates include: age, sex, BMI, smoking status, whether the patient required supplemental oxygen within 3 hours of presenting to the emergency department, number of comorbidities, number of relevant symptoms, presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, dyspnea, and hypertension.

We refer to these parameters as population mean outcomes. Let‚Äôs rewrite these parameters as functions of interventions using the framework we previously discussed. Let \\(\\dd_1(a, h) = 1\\) and \\(\\dd_0(a, h) = 0\\). Then,\n\\[\n\\theta = \\textcolor{blue}{\\E(Y^{\\dd_1})} - \\textcolor{red}{\\E(Y^{\\dd_0})}.\n\\]\nRemember, we refer to these interventions as static because they return the same value regardless of their input.\n\nWriting shift functions\nSo, how do we translate the functions \\(\\dd_1\\) and \\(\\dd_0\\) into R code to be used with lmtp? Policies can be specified using one of two arguments in lmtp estimators: shift or shifted. If using shift, we supply a two-argument function of the form\n\nd &lt;- function(data, trt) {\n  # Insert code here\n}\n\nwhere the first argument should correspond to a dataset containing all the variables in \\(O\\) and the second argument should expect a string corresponding to the variable(s) \\(A_t\\) in \\(O\\).

    "text": "So far, we‚Äôve (1) defined a causal estimand for general, hypothetical interventions, (2) identified that estimand from observational data, and (3) discussed 4 different algorithms for estimating it. It‚Äôs now time to move on to doing that in practice.\nFlexible and general software for estimation of causal effects in longitudinal studies is limited. The ipw and gfoRmula packages provide routines for estimating causal effects using inverse probability weighting (IPW) and the parametric g-formula respectively. As we already discussed, however, the validity of these methods requires making unrealistic parametric assumptions. The ltmle and survtmle packages implement a doubly-robust method for estimating causal effects from longitudinal data, but these packages do not support continuous valued exposures.\nFirst released on CRAN in the Summer of 2021, the lmtp package is the software companion to the paper by Dƒ±ÃÅaz et al. (2023) that generalized MTPs to the longitudinal setting. We hope to convince you that lmtp should be your default package for conducting causal analyses in R. For this workshop, lmtp has already been installed with webr. However, you can install the package locally on your machine from CRAN with\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"lmtp\")\n\nBefore we move on to using lmtp, here‚Äôs general information that will be applicable across all examples:\n\nData is passed to estimators through the data argument.\nData should be in wide format with one column per variable per time point under study (i.e., there should be one column for every variable in \\(O\\)). Data may be either a data.frame or tibble but not a data.table.\nColumns do not have to be in any specific order and the data may contain variables that are not used in estimation.\nThe names of treatment variables are specified with the trt argument.\nThe names of censoring variables are specified with the cens argument.\nThe names of baseline covariates are specified with the baseline argument.\nThe names of time-varying covariates are specified with the time_vary argument.\nThe trt argument accepts either a character vector or a list of character vectors.\nThe cens and baseline arguments accept character vectors.\nThe time_vary argument accepts a list of character vectors.\nThe trt, cens, and time_vary arguments must be sorted according to the time-ordering of the model with each index containing the name (or names) of variables for the given time.\nThe outcome variable is specified with the outcome argument.\nThe outcome_type argument specifies the type of outcome. It should be set to \"continuous\" for continuous outcomes, \"binomial\" for dichotomous outcomes, and \"survival\" for time-to‚Äìevent outcomes.\nCensoring indicators should be coded using 0 and 1 where 1 indicates an observation is observed at the next time and 0 indicates loss-to-follow-up. Once an observation‚Äôs censoring status is switched to 0 it cannot change back to 1. Missing data before an observation is censored is not allowed.\nThe argument should be set to for continuous outcomes, for dichotomous outcomes, and for time-to-event outcomes.\n\n\nData structure examples\n\nPoint treatment\n\n\n\nAdapted from Hoffman et al., 2022.\n\n\n\n\nPoint-treatment with censoring\n\n\n\nAdapted from Hoffman et al., 2022.\n\n\n\n\nTime-varying treatment with censoring\n\n\n\nAdapted from Hoffman et al., 2022.\n\n\n\n\nPoint-treatment with survival outcome\n\n\n\nAdapted from Hoffman et al., 2022.\n\n\n\n\nTime-varying treatment with survival outcome\n\n\n\nAdapted from Hoffman et al., 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nMachine learning ensembles\nAs was already discussed, an attractive property of multiply-robust estimators is that they can incorporate flexible machine-learning algorithms for the estimation of nuisance parameters while remaining \\(\\sqrt{n}\\)-consistent. lmtp uses the super learner algorithm for estimating these nusiance parameters. The super learner algorithm is an ensemble learner than incorporates a set of candidate models through a weighted convex-combination based on cross-validation. Asymptotically, this weighted combination of models, called the meta-learner, will outperform any single one of its components.\nlmtp uses the implementation of the super learner provided by the SuperLearner package. The algorithms to be used in the super learner are specified with the lrnrs_trt and lrnrs_outcome arguments. The outcome variable type should guide users on selecting the appropriate candidate learners for use with the lrnrs_outcome argument. Regardless of whether an exposure is continuous, dichotomous, or categorical, the exposure mechanism is estimated using classification. Therefore only include candidate learners capable of binary classification with the lrnrs_trt argument.\nCandidate learners that rely on cross-validation for the tuning of hyper-parameters should support grouped data if used with lrnrs_trt. Because estimation of the treatment mechanism relies on the augmented \\(2n\\) duplicated data set, duplicated observations must be put into the same fold during sample-splitting. This is done automatically by the package.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDƒ±ÃÅaz, Iv√°n, Nicholas Williams, Katherine L Hoffman, and Edward J Schenck. 2023. ‚ÄúNonparametric Causal Effects Based on Longitudinal Modified Treatment Policies.‚Äù Journal of the American Statistical Association 118 (542): 846‚Äì57.\n\n\nVan der Laan, Mark J, Eric C Polley, and Alan E Hubbard. 2007. ‚ÄúSuper Learner.‚Äù Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology 6 (1).\n\n\nWilliams, Nicholas, and Iv√°n Dƒ±ÃÅaz. 2023. ‚ÄúLmtp: An r Package for Estimating the Causal Effects of Modified Treatment Policies.‚Äù Observational Studies 9 (2): 103‚Äì22.",
