| Symbol                                          | Definition                                                                             |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| $L_t$                                           | Time-varying covariates                                                                |
| $A_t$                                           | A vector of intervention variables (i..e, treatment or exposure)                       |
| $Y$                                             | An outcome variable. Earlier measures of the outcome can be included in $L_t$.         |          
| $C_t$                                           | A indicator variable that a unit is *observed* at the next time point                  |
| $O_1, ..., O_n$                                 | A sample of $n$ i.i.d observations with $O = (L_1, A_1, C_1, L_2, A_2, C_2, ..., L_\tau, A_\tau, C_\tau, Y)$ |
| $\bar{X}_t = (X_1, ..., X_t)$                   | The history of a variable up until time $t$                                            |
| $\underline{X}_t = (X_t, ..., X_\tau)$          | The future of a variable, including time $t$                                           |
| $H_t = (\bar{A}_{t-1}, \bar{L}_t)$              | The history of all variables up until just before $A_t$                                |
| $\g_t(a_t, h_t) = \P(A_t = a_t \mid H_t = h_t)$ | The probability density function of $A_t$ conditional on $H_t = h_t$                   |
