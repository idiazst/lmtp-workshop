::: tldr
In this workshop, we generalize static and dynamic interventions for categorical, continuous, and multivariate exposures. Specifically, we consider a generalization called modified treatment policies (MTPs), which are hypothetical interventions where the post-intervention is defined as a modification of the natural value of the exposure that can depend on the unitâ€™s history. This short course will introduce the **lmtp** R package for estimating the causal effects of these general estimand in both point-treatment and longitudinal studies. We will discuss identification of MTPs, estimation with a targeted minimum-loss based estimator and a sequentially doubly-robust estimator, and provide guidance on estimator choice.

### Learning objectives

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

1.  Generalize static and dynamic interventions intuitively and using notation.

2.  Estimate the effect of a static or dynamic intervention with \textbf{lmtp} for point-treatment and longitudinal studies.

3.  Estimate the effect of an MTP on a continuous-valued exposure with \textbf{lmtp} for point-treatment and longitudinal studies.

4.  Estimate the effect of multivariate exposures with \textbf{lmtp} for point-treatment and longitudinal studies.

### webR

This workshop was prepared using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/). The source code is available on GitHub. webR is a version of the R programming language compiled to be run directly in the browser. Using webR for this workshop avoids having to spend time setting up a computing environment and making sure workshop participants are using the same version of R and R packages.
