title: "Estimating the causal effects of binary, categorical, continuous, and multivariate exposures in R"
---

> SER 2024 - Austin, Texas

Modified treatment policies (MTPs) are a class of interventions that generalize static and dynamic interventions for categorical, continuous, and multivariate exposures. MTPs are hypothetical interventions where the post-intervention is defined as a modification of the natural value of the exposure that can depend on the unitâ€™s history. This short course will introduce the **lmtp** R package for estimating the causal effects of MTPs in both point-treatment and longitudinal studies. We will discuss identification of MTPs, estimation with a targeted minimum-loss based estimator and a sequentially doubly-robust estimator, and provide guidance on estimator choice.

### Learning objectives

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

1.  Define MTPs intuitively and using notation, and understand how they generalize static and dynamic interventions.

2.  Estimate the effect of a static or dynamic intervention with \textbf{lmtp} for point-treatment and longitudinal studies.

3.  Estimate the effect of an MTP on a continuous-valued exposure with \textbf{lmtp} for point-treatment and longitudinal studies.

4.  Estimate the effect of multivariate exposures with \textbf{lmtp} for point-treatment and longitudinal studies.
